# EchoesOfGreen

## Inspiration
The idea for Echoes of Green was born from a fascination with dystopian worlds where nature has been completely erased. We wanted to explore a society where industry and technology have overtaken everything, leaving no memory of the natural world. The game is inspired by cyberpunk themes, environmental storytelling, and classic sci-fi narratives that question control, freedom, and the pursuit of truth.
## What it does
Echoes of Green is a story-driven adventure game where players uncover a long-lost secret hidden beneath an oppressive industrial society. As the protagonist, players navigate a world devoid of nature, uncover classified archives, and fight against the forces that want to keep the truth buried. The game combines exploration and action-packed combat against robotic enforcers, leading up to a climactic showdown with a guardian.
## How we built it
We developed the game using Unreal Engine, leveraging its powerful lighting and rendering tools to create a stark contrast between the cold industrial world and the hidden beauty of nature. The soundtrack and artwork were hand crafted to reinforce the feeling of isolation and discovery.
## Challenges we ran into
Asset installation and data migration issues. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re especially proud of the immersive world-building – every environment tells a story and our team hand made the sights and sounds the player directly interacts with. 
## What we learned
Our team learned how to create an immersive world within UE5 working with: animations, character models, level design, lighting design, sound design, cutscene artwork, voice acting, enemy AI behavior, and so much more!
## What's next for Echos of Green 
We plan to expand the game with:
More hidden lore and side quests that deepen the mystery.
Additional enemy types and AI improvements to enhance combat.
A refined ending with multiple outcomes, depending on player choices.
